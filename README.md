# TomBot-Sharp
C# Version of TomBot



TomBot Sharp is a Discord Bot.



## Contributing

 TomBot is built in C# for DotNet Core. While this can be developed in Visual Studio, VS Code or really any text editor you want, I (Ela) use JetBrains Rider because I get it free. If you are a student/affiliated with an academic organisation, you can get it free as well. More info is [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). 
 
 Only Ela and those approved may work on the "dev" branch and only Ela may work on the "master" branch.



### Getting the code

1. Clone the Git repo. I don't really care what you use to do this.
2. Create/Checkout the branch for what you are working on. Be descriptive in the title. If you are working on quotes, call it something like "quotes". If you are fixing an issue with a command, use something like "fixing-command-<commandname>"
3. Do your code. Make it pretty etc.
4. Commit your code to your branch.
5. Create a pull request, describing the changes, who's worked on them, what they fix and what they break.
6. Wait for it to be accepted.



### Important Notes

- TomBot builds to DotNet Core 2.1. This is because of Discord.Net.
- TomBot uses Discord.Net for its Discord library.
- Remember to drink while coding.
- TomBot requires build events. Please enable this feature in your build process options if using Rider. If you are not using Rider or Visual Studio, build in one of these. Learn more about the options for Rider and ReSharper [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Build_Process.html#supported-build-items).
